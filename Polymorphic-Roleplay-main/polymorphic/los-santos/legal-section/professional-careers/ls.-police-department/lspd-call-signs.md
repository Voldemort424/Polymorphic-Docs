# **LSPD Call Signs** 🚔

LSPD callsigns are structured to indicate the officer's role, rank, and assigned area or unit. This guide provides a format for callsigns to streamline radio communication and align with department structure.

---

## **Callsign Format** 📝

**\[Unit Letter] - \[Assignment Number] - \[Individual Number]**

Each segment of the callsign represents key information about the officer or unit.

1. **Unit Letter** 📡: Indicates the primary assignment of the officer or unit.  
   Examples:
   - **A (Adam)** - Patrol Division
   - **K (King)** - K9 Unit
   - **R (Robert)** - Robbery-Homicide
   - **S (Sam)** - SWAT
   - **D (David)** - Detectives
   - **T (Tom)** - Traffic Enforcement

2. **Assignment Number** 🔢: Identifies the shift, sector, or specific team. Use a 1- or 2-digit number to indicate specifics within the division or patrol area.  
   Example: “2” might indicate the second shift or area 2 within the division.

3. **Individual Number** #️⃣: Typically a 1- or 2-digit number unique to the officer. This allows distinction between members of the same unit.  
   Example: Officer #3 on the unit would use “3.”

## **Choosing a Badge Number** 🔑

1. **Personal Significance** 💖: Members can choose numbers with personal meaning, such as significant dates or favorite numbers, as long as they fit within the three- or four-digit range.
   
2. **Professional Rank Distinction** 🏅: Higher badge numbers can help indicate higher rank or seniority if desired for roleplay immersion.

3. **Avoid Duplicates** 🚫: Each badge number should be unique, so members may check with the department’s roster or administration to confirm availability.
