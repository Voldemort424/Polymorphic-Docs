# **Use of Force** ⚖️

***

## **Purpose** 🎯

To ensure officers use appropriate force in line with department policies and avoid excessive force in various situations.

---

## **A. Use of Force Continuum** 🔄

### 1. **Presence** 👮
- The mere presence of an officer often deters crime. Wearing a uniform, displaying professional demeanor, and maintaining composure can prevent escalation.

### 2. **Verbal Commands** 🗣️
- Use calm, clear, and firm language. Sometimes, a verbal command can prevent a situation from escalating.

### 3. **Physical Force** 💪
- If necessary, employ physical tactics like controlling holds, joint locks, or pressure points.

### 4. **Less-Lethal Force** ⚡
- Use tools like tasers, pepper spray, or batons for non-lethal intervention when a suspect poses a threat but does not warrant lethal force.

### 5. **Lethal Force** ☠️
- Only use lethal force when there is an immediate and credible threat to life or when the suspect is armed and dangerous.

## **B. Documenting Use of Force** 📝

### 1. **Write Detailed Reports** 📑
- Always file a report explaining why force was used and the level of force employed. Be clear about your decision-making process.

### 2. **Body Camera and Dash Cam** 📷
- Review footage immediately after a use of force incident and include it in your report.
