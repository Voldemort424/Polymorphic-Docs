## <mark style="color:yellow;">**The Risks of Running an Illegal Business**</mark>

* **Competing Gangs**:
  * Rival gangs may attempt to sabotage or steal your business.
  * Protect your turf and retaliate if necessary to ensure your business stays profitable.
* **Law Enforcement**:
  * The longer you run an illegal business, the higher the chances of attracting the attention of the police.
  * If you get caught, you may face **arrests** or your business may be **seized**.
* **Rival Business Owners**:
  * Compete with other players who may own businesses in the same industry. You can challenge their turf and take over their operations.
