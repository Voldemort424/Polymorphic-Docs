# Territories

***

Territories are the foundation of gang power. Owning territories grants influence and resources, but maintaining control requires effort.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Territories and Turf Wars</mark>

1. <mark style="color:orange;">**Capturing Territories**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">:</mark>
   * Sell drugs to NPCs.
   * Spray your gang tag on walls.
   * Spend time actively present in the territory.
2. <mark style="color:orange;">**Maintaining Control**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">:</mark>
   * Loyalty in a territory decays over time.
   * Actions by rival gangs, such as spraying their tags or killing residents, will lower your loyalty.
   * Protect businesses and residents to ensure stability.
3. <mark style="color:orange;">**Loyalty Points System**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">:</mark>
   * Gain loyalty by:
     * **Presence**: +40 points every 120 minutes.
     * **Drug Sales**: +20 points per sale.
     * **Spraying Tags**: +80 points per spray.
4. <mark style="color:orange;">**Strategic Note**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">:</mark>

### <mark style="color:yellow;">**Racketeering**</mark>

Control territories to unlock the ability to collect protection money from local businesses.

* <mark style="color:orange;">**Passive Income**</mark>: Earn hourly protection fees from businesses in your territory.
* <mark style="color:orange;">**Risks**</mark>: If a business is robbed, you'll lose a portion of your protection income.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">**Rivalries**</mark>

Rivalries add a competitive edge to Turf Wars, allowing gangs to challenge one another for control.

* <mark style="color:orange;">**Starting a Rivalry**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">:</mark>
  * Deposit a minimum fund to initiate a rivalry in another gang's territory.
* <mark style="color:orange;">**Mechanics**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">:</mark>
  * Rivalries last for 48 hours.
  * During this period, both gangs earn only 50% of the profits from drug sales. The other 50% is added to a shared pool.
  * The gang selling the most drugs during the rivalry wins the pool and the territory.
* <mark style="color:orange;">**Strategic Advantage**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">:</mark> Rivalries are anonymous, keeping the attacking gangâ€™s identity hidden.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">**Loyalty Spread Mechanic**</mark>

When you gain loyalty in a zone, neighboring territories receive a small portion of loyalty. This ensures that no gang is entirely isolated and encourages strategic territorial expansion.
