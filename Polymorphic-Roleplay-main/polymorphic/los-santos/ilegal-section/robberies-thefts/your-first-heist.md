# Your First Heist

## **Choosing Your First Heist**

* As a beginner, youâ€™ll start with easier jobs, but the rewards will be modest. Start with jobs like **Fleeca Bank** or **Laundromat Robbery** to get a feel for the heist mechanics.
* **Your Options**:
  * **Art Asylum**: Steal priceless artwork.
  * **Casino Heist**: Rob the vault at the casino without triggering alarms.
  * **Fleeca Bank**: A classic heist, robbing the smaller Fleeca banks around the city.
