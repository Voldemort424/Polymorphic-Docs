# Your Tablet

## <mark style="color:yellow;">**Your Criminal Operations Hub**</mark><mark style="color:yellow;">:</mark>

* The **Heist Tablet** is the central tool for all heists. It’s your personal gateway to access contracts, communicate with your crew, monitor heist progression, and manage operations on the go.
* Through the tablet, you’ll unlock **various tiers of heists** as your reputation and skills grow. Each tier represents an increase in **difficulty**, **complexity**, and **reward**.
* The tablet isn’t just a tool. It’s a **living** element of your character’s criminal empire. You’ll need to keep it secure, as other players can attempt to hack or steal information from it.
